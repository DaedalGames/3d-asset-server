# 3D Asset Server quick start

**3D Asset Server** searches 23 3D asset sites at once and downloads what you pick, ready to drop into a game or a website. Results cover 3D models, PBR materials, textures, HDRIs and game asset packs, and every result shows its licence.

The public server at **https://3d.shep.bot** is free and needs no account or API key.

## Pick how you want to use it

| You want to… | Use | Start here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browse and download assets yourself | The web search | [/search](/search) |
| Let Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot or another agent fetch assets | The MCP server at `https://3d.shep.bot/mcp` | [Coding agents & MCP](/docs/mcp) |
| Call it from a script, build tool or backend | The REST API | [REST API guide](/docs/api) |
| Explore every endpoint and try requests | The interactive reference | [API reference](/docs/api/reference) |

## Connect your coding agent (30 seconds)

For **Claude Code**, run this once:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http 3d-assets https://3d.shep.bot/mcp
```

Then ask for what you need:

```text
Find a CC0 sunset HDRI and a mossy rock PBR material (2k) and put them in ./assets.
Tell me the licence of each.
```

Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI and the Claude apps take the same URL. See [Coding agents & MCP](/docs/mcp) for each one.

## Or call the API

```bash
# Search every source for free low-poly tree models
curl "https://3d.shep.bot/v1/search?q=low+poly+tree&type=model&free=true&limit=5"

# Details and files for one result
curl "https://3d.shep.bot/v1/assets/polyhaven:ArmChair_01"

# Download it as glTF (multi-file assets arrive as one zip)
curl -L -o armchair.zip "https://3d.shep.bot/v1/assets/polyhaven:ArmChair_01/download?format=gltf&resolution=2k"
```

## What a search returns

Every search returns two lists:

- **`results`**: assets merged from all sources, ranked by text match, the source's own ranking, whether they're free and whether files can be downloaded directly. Each one has an `id` like `polyhaven:ArmChair_01`, a `license`, a `price`, known `formats` and `resolutions`, and `downloadable`.
- **`providers`**: one status line per source (`ok`, `error`, `timeout`, `skipped` or `link`). Sites that block bots (Fab, Poliigon, TurboSquid) come back as `link` with a `searchUrl` that runs the same search on their site.

A slow or broken source never fails the search.

## Licences

Assets keep the licence of the site they come from. Poly Haven, ambientCG, Kenney, TextureCan and 3DTextures.me publish under **CC0** (public domain: commercial use, no credit needed). Others are royalty-free, need attribution, or are paid. Check `license.attributionRequired` before you ship. See [Sources & licences](/docs/sources).
